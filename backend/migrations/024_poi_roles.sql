-- Migration 024: POI Roles
-- Adds poi_roles TEXT[] column, seeds from poi_type, merges boundary/virtual
-- duplicate pairs, and adds Peninsula boundary geometry.
-- Survivors: virtual POIs (they hold org context + news/events). Boundary
-- geometry is copied to survivors; boundary POIs are soft-deleted.

-- 1. Add column (idempotent)
ALTER TABLE pois ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS poi_roles TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}';

-- 2. Seed roles from poi_type for rows that haven't been seeded yet
UPDATE pois SET poi_roles = ARRAY[poi_type] WHERE poi_roles = '{}' OR poi_roles IS NULL;

-- 3. GIN index for role queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_pois_roles ON pois USING GIN (poi_roles);
